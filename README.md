# FreightHub Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to the frontend coding challenge. Fork this repository and follow the instructions below.

Your goal is to set up an application, where the admin is able to manage shipments.

Business need
===

The main goal is for the admin to check the shipments at a glance. This allows admins to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issue.

Use cases
===

- The admin shall be able to see shipments in pages of 20 elements per page.
- The admin shall be able to search for shipment id and sort by different fields.
- The admin shall be able to see the shipment information on a shipment details page
- The admin shall be able to update the shipment name

The interactions should not refresh the page.

Technology requirements
===

You can use any libraries, task runners and build processors. React and Javascript are the only requirements. ES6 and typescript are highly encouraged, as well as MST and MobX if needed.

Server side
===

The boilerplate includes a small service for data fetching. `db.json` includes all the necessary data to achieve the goal. Please follow the steps below to start the server:

```
yarn or npm install .
yarn start or npm start
```

Please check [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for more information.

Deliveries
===

Push the application to your github account and send the link to your contact person.

Good luck,
The FreightHub Team
