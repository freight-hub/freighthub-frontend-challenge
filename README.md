# FreightHub Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to the user interface coding challenge. Fork this repository and follow the instructions below.

Your goal is to set up a react application, where the customer is able to list all the available shipments located in a map and be able to search for specific one.

Business need
===

The main goal of the list is for the customer to check all the shipments in progress at a glance. This allows users to take faster decisions and plan ahead of time.

Providing information to the customer increases transparency and reduces communication issue.

Use cases
===

- The user shall be able to see all the available shipments in pages of 20 elements per page.
- The user shall be able to search for shipment id and sort by different fields.
- The user shall be able to see the shipment information on a shipment details page
- The user shall be able to update the shipment name

The interactions should not refresh the page.

Technology requirements
===

You can use any libraries, task runners and build processors. React and Javascript are the only requirements. ES6 and typescript are highly encouraged, as well as MST and MobX if needed.

Server side
===

The boilerplate includes a small service for data fetching. `db.json` includes all the necessary data to achieve the goal. Please follow the steps below to start the server:

```
yarn or npm install .
yarn start or npm start
```

—— ADD TABLE WITH ENDPOINTS —— 

Deliveries
===

Push the application to your github account and send the link to your contact person.
